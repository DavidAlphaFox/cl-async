title: Merging in futures and TCP stream branches
layout: post
---
Over the past few days, I've been documenting some of the branches of cl-async
that I think add a lot of useful functionality. These include the [TCP
stream](/cl-async/tcp-stream) implementation (lisp streams on top of cl-async
non-blocking sockets) and [futures](/cl-async/future) which provide a useful
abstraction for asynchronous programming. These branches have now been merged in
to the master branch and are ready for use.

The docs are complete, so feel free to give them a try.
